# Knowledge Graph Training with Internal SPR and RCC

This project implements a novel approach to knowledge graph reasoning by combining Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) and Region Connection Calculus (RCC) within the model's internal latent space, enhanced by pure reinforcement learning techniques. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external knowledge graphs, our implementation leverages the model's internal representations and self-discovered reasoning patterns to perform complex reasoning tasks.

## Key Features

### 1. Internal Knowledge Representation
- **SPR Encoding**: Transforms complex concepts into minimal, context-rich representations in latent space
- **RCC Integration**: Implements spatial reasoning directly in the neural network's latent space
- **Latent Space Optimization**: Balances sparsity with information preservation

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Framework
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**:
  - Optimizes reasoning policies without a critic model
  - Enables efficient learning of complex reasoning patterns
  - Promotes faster convergence to optimal solutions

- **Rule-based Reward System**:
  - Incentivizes accurate reasoning and explicit explanation
  - Rewards self-corrective behaviors
  - Encourages metacognitive development

### 3. Metacognitive Capabilities
- **Self-Reflection Mechanism**:
  - Monitors reasoning progress
  - Identifies potential mistakes
  - Initiates self-correction procedures

- **'A-ha' Moment Detection**:
  - Enables spontaneous reasoning pattern discovery
  - Supports dynamic strategy adjustment
  - Facilitates breakthrough moments in complex reasoning tasks

- **Adaptive Reasoning Time**:
  - Dynamically allocates thinking time based on problem complexity
  - Balances speed and accuracy
  - Optimizes resource utilization
